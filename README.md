# JavaScript Random Password Generator

## DESCRIPTION
Using Javascript, this page will gather criteria and generate a random password to match criteria given by the user. Designed as a test of beginner Javascript, the techniques I used to acheive a working password generator include the following:  

* Pseudocoding logic to see what needs to happen in js
* Declaring variables and functions
* Utilizing prompts to gather user input and conditional statements to validate the input
* For loop with Math functions to generate random characters from a string that meet the given criteria
